- ‚úÖ **Wall and Room Attenuation**: Realistic muffling and volume reduction through walls
- ‚úÖ **Variable Sound Ranges**: Each sound source has appropriate radius (small/medium/large)
- ‚úÖ **No Manual Activation**: All interactions are automatic and proximity-based
- ‚úÖ **Automatic Item Pickup**: Items collected when player approaches
- ‚úÖ **Automatic Door Unlocking**: Doors unlock when player has required key
- ‚úÖ **Level-Specific Items**: Items don't carry between levels

### Technical Excellence ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ **All 36 tests pass** - Comprehensive test coverage
- ‚úÖ **Cross-platform builds** - Web, iOS, Android, macOS support verified
- ‚úÖ **Performance optimized** - Smooth gameplay with multiple audio sources
- ‚úÖ **Clean architecture** - Modular systems following Flutter/Flame best practices
- ‚úÖ **Debug capabilities** - Extensive visualization and testing tools

## Next Phase Recommendation: "NPC and Advanced Gameplay"

With all core systems complete, the next logical phase should focus on:

### Phase 6: NPC System Implementation (4-6 weeks)
**Prerequisites**: All current systems (‚úÖ Complete)

**Proposed Sub-phases**:
1. **Basic NPC Framework** (Week 1)
   - NPC component system with AI state machine
   - Basic movement and pathfinding
   - Audio signature system for NPC identification

2. **NPC Types Implementation** (Week 2-3)
   - Hunter, Stalker, Berserker (instant kill types)
   - Phantom, Silencer, Deafener (hearing effect types)
   - Monaural, Thief, Stunner (special ability types)

3. **Player-NPC Interaction** (Week 4)
   - Collision detection and damage system
   - Status effects for hearing loss NPCs
   - Stealth and evasion mechanics

4. **Advanced Level Design** (Week 5-6)
   - NPC-enabled versions of existing levels
   - Survival challenges with multiple NPCs
   - Balance testing and difficulty tuning

### Phase 7: Polish and Release Preparation (3-4 weeks)
**Prerequisites**: NPC System (Pending)

1. **Performance Optimization**
2. **Accessibility Testing**
3. **Platform-specific Polish**
4. **User Experience Refinement**
