# Dark Room Game - Implementation Plan

## Project Status Analysis

### Current State
- **Project Structure**: Standard Flutter project with cross-platform support (iOS, Android, Linux, macOS, Windows, Web)
- **Main Application**: Currently contains default Flutter counter app (lib/main.dart:1)
- **Dependencies**: Basic Flutter setup with no Flame engine integration yet
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive game design document exists (GAME_DESIGN.md)
- **Platform Support**: All target platforms configured with proper native code structure

### Key Findings
1. **Missing Flame Integration**: pubspec.yaml:30 needs Flame engine dependency
2. **No Game Code**: lib/main.dart:1 contains Flutter demo app, not game implementation
3. **No Audio Dependencies**: Missing audio libraries for 3D spatial audio
4. **No Asset Structure**: No audio assets or game resources configured

- **Performance**: Regular performance testing, especially on mobile devices

### Design Risks
- **Difficulty Balance**: Extensive playtesting with target users
- **Accessibility**: Early and frequent testing with visually impaired users
- **Audio Quality**: Professional audio review and testing

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Research 3D Audio Libraries**: Identify best Dart/Flutter library for spatial audio with occlusion support
2. **Set Up Development Environment**: Ensure all team members can build and run
3. **Create Basic Game Shell**: Replace default Flutter app with minimal Flame game
4. **Implement Debug Mode Toggle**: Create F3/D key handler for debug visualization
5. **Implement Basic Movement**: Get player moving with collision detection
6. **Debug Renderer**: Create wireframe rendering system for map visualization

## Sound System Implementation Priority

### Immediate Tasks (Next 1-2 weeks)
1. **Update Current Audio System**: Modify existing `SpatialAudioComponent` and `GameObject` classes to support always-playing sounds
2. **Implement Wall Occlusion**: Add wall detection between player and sound sources for volume/filtering effects
3. **Sound Radius Categories**: Update sound source creation to use small/medium/large radius presets
4. **Continuous Audio Loop Management**: Ensure sounds never stop playing, only volume changes
5. **Volume Transition Smoothing**: Implement smooth volume changes as player moves

### Technical Changes Required
1. **SpatialAudioComponent**: Modify to continuously play sounds instead of start/stop behavior
2. **AudioManager**: Update to handle multiple simultaneous looping sounds with individual volume control
3. **GameObject**: Remove manual sound activation, implement always-on behavior for soundSource type
4. **Wall Component**: Add occlusion calculation methods for sound attenuation
5. **Level Design**: Create sound source placement tools with radius visualization

### Testing Plan
1. **Sound Continuity**: Verify all sound sources play continuously without interruption
2. **Volume Accuracy**: Test smooth volume transitions based on player distance
3. **Wall Effects**: Validate muffling and volume reduction through walls/rooms
4. **Performance**: Ensure multiple simultaneous looping sounds don't impact performance
5. **Radius Categories**: Confirm small/medium/large objects have appropriate audio ranges
